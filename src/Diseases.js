Infected plants develop yellowing between leaf veins and curled, crumpled leaves, which can significantly reduce fruit yield. The virus is transmitted by the whitefly (Bemisia tabaci), which spreads the disease from plant to plant. TYLCV thrives in warm climates and can quickly spread in fields or greenhouses where whiteflies are present, leading to widespread crop damage if not controlled.",

Algal leaf spot thrives in warm, humid environments and is most common in tropical and subtropical regions. While typically not fatal to plants, severe infections can lead to premature leaf drop and reduced vigor, particularly in weakened or stressed plants. The disease spreads through splashing water, making moisture control key to its management.",

Affected vines may also exhibit “tiger stripe” patterns on leaves and black or brown spots on berries. The disease is most prevalent in older vines and is favored by warm, dry conditions. Esca can lead to reduced vine vigor, poor fruit quality, and, in severe cases, the vine's eventual death, impacting vineyard productivity.",

The disease is characterized by dark, olive-green to black, velvety spots that appear on the leaves, fruit, and sometimes young twigs. Infected leaves may become distorted and fall prematurely, while scabs on the fruit can cause deformities and make them less marketable. Apple scab thrives in cool, wet conditions, and its spores spread through wind and rain, especially during spring. If left unmanaged, the disease can significantly reduce fruit yield and quality, particularly in orchards with high humidity.",
    preventive_measures: [

Black Sigatoka is more aggressive, causing quicker leaf damage. Both thrive in warm, humid conditions, reducing photosynthesis and yield. They spread via wind-borne spores, making them a major threat to banana production. Management includes resistant varieties, fungicides, and practices to lower humidity.",

It starts as small, gray-green lesions on the leaves, which expand into long, cigar-shaped, brown spots. The disease thrives in cool, humid conditions and can significantly reduce photosynthesis, leading to lower yields if left unchecked. Northern leaf blight spreads via wind and rain, making it a major concern in corn-growing regions. Effective management includes using resistant hybrids, crop rotation, and fungicide application when necessary.",
